A quote I really like:

A little about me:

I'm a senior Math-CS major student, and my personal interest is video game development, especially in the graphic aspect. I'm trying to learn more about the game industry right now, along with some graph technologies by takie the CSE167 series courses offered at UCSD.

I'm also a amateur video game streamer, just doing it for fun. My channel is [here](https://www.twitch.tv/shikakanee).

I love music a lot, especilly Kpop, Jpop, and Jrock, here's some of my favorite artists:
* Taeyeon
* Baekhyun
* One Ok Rock
* YOASOBI
